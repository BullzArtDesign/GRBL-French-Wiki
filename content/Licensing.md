##Licensing for Grbl v0.9:

***
####_Note from the Grbl v0.9 author:_

_After releasing Grbl v0.8 (and prior) under the permissive MIT-license, several commercial entities have inquired about obtaining an MIT-license for the latest version, Grbl v0.9, to use in their proprietary products. At the time, Grbl v0.9 was developed under the "copy-left" GPLv3 license. While the strong interest was extremely humbling, it brought up some concerns about taking steps to protect Grbl for the open-source community but to still allow use for entrepreneurs. While the path forward is being worked out, Grbl v0.9 will remain under the GPLv3 license, and all older versions will remain open and permissive under the MIT-license._
